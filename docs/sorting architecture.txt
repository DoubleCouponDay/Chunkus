problem
	I am trying to sort boundary chunks immediately after they get flagged as a boundary but it is not working

guess
	the boundary chunks are sometimes not adjacent to the first or last boundary chunks

try
	handle chunks that are not adjacent to the first or last chunk in the same function

	any adjacent chunk can be on the boundary

	try to find at least two adjacent chunks that are boundaries

	if current chunk is adjacent to first and boundary left == 1
		in a condition, append to last before appending to first. this prevents the boundary flipping over

	path find all the way back to first and last. complete the entire path

	in add_chunk_to_boundary, account for special scenario where current chunk is already in a boundary but it still needs to be zipped.
	
	if chunk already in boundary, assume it has already been sorted
		still needs to be zipped

scenario 1
	two shapes are being merged together
	
	the smaller shapes first and last boundary chunk are sorted into the larger
	
	the smaller first chunk gets set to the larger last chunks next chunk.
	
	the smaller last chunk is not adjacent to largers first or last chunks
	
	it is found that top and bot are adjacent.
	
	top is already connected so it is not relevant
	
	the next property of current is set to bot
	
scenario 2
	current is not adjacent with first or last
	
	bot and right are adjacent
	
	pathfind all the way back to first and last
	
scenario 3
	current is not adjacent with first or last
