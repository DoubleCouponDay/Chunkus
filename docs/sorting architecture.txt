problem
	I am trying to sort boundary chunks immediately after they get flagged as a boundary but it is not working

guess
	the boundary chunks are sometimes not adjacent to the first or last boundary chunks

try
	build the boundary backwards until it hits the last chunk

	left, top left, top, top right chunks can never be on the boundary

	try to find two adajacent chunks that are boundaries

	bot_left, bot, bot_right, right are possible boundaries

	assume there to be at most 3 boundaries

	if current chunk is adjacent to first and boundary left == 1
		special check for the 2nd chunk to ensure it becomes last and not first

	if less than 2 found
		set last chunks next to current

	if 2 or 3 found
		if this is the first loop, save the chunk furthest away from the last chunk for later

		if 2 found
			set furthest away chunk to next

			set closest chunks next to current chunk

		if 3 found
			set furthest away's chunk's next to second furthest away

			set second furthest away chunk to next

			set closest chunk's next to current

		do not add these boundaries to the shapes boundary list

	in add_chunk_to_boundary, account for special scenario where current chunk is already in a boundary but it still needs to be added to same shape and zipped.
